## Plan
I’m Brandon Hammond, a web developer, graphic artist, and photographer from Carrollton, Georgia. I am building a freelance design agency website to showcase my abilities and attract potential clients. According to Brian F., a writer for Hostinger, “it only takes a user 2.6 seconds to create their first impression of a website” (F., Brian). My goal is to have a very clean and professional look that will not only showcase my design abilities, but also my development skills. My audience is a bit broad because I want to market my photography/videography skills on top of my development and design abilities. I am mainly planning to target realtors and real estate brokers, offering website builds/maintenance, real estate photography, videography, social media content design and any branding design that they may need. I am thinking about having one showcase section dedicated to everything I want to offer to real estate professionals. Then I want to build separate sections to showcase individual skills, like a section for video, a section for photos, etc. My wife is a real estate agent and the source of a lot of my inspiration. Vicki Davis’ third recommendation in her 11 essentials for excellent digital portfolios is to select a variety of content (Davis). I think this will be relatively simple since I have such a variety of skills to offer.

My biggest struggle point may be clearly communicating what it is that I can do. My goal is to keep text short and sweet, highlighting only the important things on the homepage. “Because there are so many different types of design and various specializations, it’s not safe to assume that visitors will have a clear understanding of the services that are offered without them being communicated” (WDD Staff). This is the reason that I really need to focus on making sure that what I offer is clearly visible on the homepage.

As far as design, I want the site to be clean, but also showcase my abilities. “Because design is an artistic and creative profession, the website of a freelance designer is seen as a true representation of their work and their skill levels.” (WDD Staff). I really need to hit a home run with the design. The home page needs to be an attention grabber. I will also include a showcase page of past work, an about me page, and a contact page. Fortunately, the area that I plan on marketing to doesn’t have very many web developers, and the ones that do exist aren’t exactly using best practices. Most of them are offering simple plug and play templates, whereas my services will be much more extensive. I, personally, like things customized to my liking and preferences and want to offer that to my clientele. For example, there’s a developer in the area who offers brokerages their own sites and sites for each of their realtors in the package. This sounds great, but the realtors have no control over the look and feel of their personal pages. Not only that, but they don’t even have a domain, so they can’t generate good traffic to their own page and stand out in the crowd.
